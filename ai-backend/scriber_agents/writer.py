            Write a professional football game recap article (400-600 words) with the following structure:
            - Headline
            - Introduction (context, teams, stakes)
            - Body (game storyline, key moments, player performances, relevant statistics, quotes)
            - Conclusion (summary, implications)
            Include [Headline, Introduction, Body, Conclusion] in the article to make it easier for the junior writer to understand the structure.

            CRITICAL: You must clearly distinguish between CURRENT MATCH DATA and HISTORICAL/BACKGROUND DATA.

            CURRENT MATCH DATA (Primary Focus - This is what actually happened in this specific game):
            - This contains the actual events, scores, players, and moments from THIS SPECIFIC MATCH
            - Use this as your main source for describing what happened in the game
            - Focus on: goals, cards, substitutions, key moments, final score, venue, date

            SUBSTITUTION DATA STRUCTURE:
            - Substitution events have: "player" (who went OFF), "assist" (who came ON), "time", "detail"
            - If "assist" is null/missing, the substitution data is incomplete
            - Lineup data shows: "startXI" (starters), "substitutes" (bench players)
            - Only mention substitutions when both "player" and "assist" fields are present
            - Note that "assist" could both mean substitution and goal assist, make sure to check the "type" field to determine if it is a substitution or a goal assist

            HISTORICAL/BACKGROUND DATA (Context Only - Use sparingly for introduction/context):
            - This contains background information, historical context, and analysis
            - Use this ONLY for:
              * Brief introduction context (team history, league position, etc.)
              * Background information that helps explain the significance
              * Historical rivalry or previous meetings (if relevant)
            - DO NOT confuse this with current match events
            - DO NOT use historical statistics as if they happened in this game

            CRITICAL MATCHING RULES:
            - When mentioning players, teams, or events, use EXACTLY the names and details from the provided data
            - Do not mix up player names, team names, or event times
            - If a player name is unclear or incomplete in the data, do not guess or complete it
            - Verify that each player mentioned actually participated in the specific event described
            - Only mention players who have clear, verifiable actions in the match events
            - Double-check all player names, team names, and event details against the provided data
            - The goal can not be assigned to the assist player:
            - EXAMPLE: If Player A scores one goal assisted by Player B, and Player B scores one goal assisted by Player A, DO NOT write that either player "scored a double" or "netted twice".
                - For example, in the match where Arsenal beat Wolves 2-0, Saka scored once (assisted by Havertz) and Havertz scored once (assisted by Saka). Neither scored twice — this must NOT be described as a "brace" or "double".
            - When counting goals per player, treat only explicit scoring events in the CURRENT MATCH DATA as valid.
            - A player who scored one goal and provided one assist MUST NOT be described as scoring twice.
            - For clarity: DO NOT use phrases like "brace", "double", "netted twice", "second tally", or similar variations unless the player is explicitly recorded as scoring two distinct goals.
            - KEY FACTUAL RULE:
                - Goal count per player must match the number of goal events where the player is listed as "scorer".
                - Assist does NOT count as a goal.
                
            CRITICAL SUBSTITUTION RULES:
            - ONLY mention substitutions when you have COMPLETE information about who went OFF and who came ON
            - In substitution events: "player" field = who went OFF, "assist" field = who came ON
            - DO NOT guess or assume who came on as a substitute
            - DO NOT mention partial substitution information (e.g., "Player X was substituted off" without knowing who replaced them)
            - Cross-reference with lineup data: "startXI" = starters, "substitutes" = bench players
            - Only describe substitutions that are strategically important and have complete information
            - When in doubt about substitution details, exclude rather than include

            Instructions:
            - Write a complete article following the template structure exactly
            - PRIORITIZE CURRENT MATCH DATA - focus on what actually happened in this specific game
            - Use historical/background data ONLY for context and introduction, not as main story
            - When describing events, clearly indicate they happened in THIS match
            - Do not mix up historical statistics with current match statistics
            - Use only the provided data - do not invent statistics or quotes
            - When describing goals, DO NOT specify the shot type (e.g., header, volley, long-range)
            - Use data efficiently and do not miss critical information from the current match data like goals, score, etc.
            - Maintain a consistent, professional tone, and do not make professional mistakes like using wrong team names, wrong scores, etc.
            - Ensure the article is between 400-600 words
            - Include all required sections: Headline, Introduction, Body, Conclusion
            - The main story should be about THIS GAME, not historical background
            - Be extremely careful with player names, team names, and event details - use only what is explicitly stated in the data
            - CRITICAL: For substitutions, only mention them when you have complete information (both who went off AND who came on)
            - CRITICAL: If substitution data is incomplete (missing "assist" field), do not mention the substitution at all
