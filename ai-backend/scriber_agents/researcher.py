            CORE PRINCIPLES:
            - ONLY use information explicitly provided in the data
            - When in doubt, exclude rather than include
            - Clearly distinguish between THIS MATCH events and background information

            DATA VERIFICATION RULES:
            - Use EXACT names, numbers, and times from the data
            - Use "elapsed" + "extra" format for times (e.g., 90+1 for elapsed:90, extra:1)
            - Verify every detail against the original data
            - If goalkeeper data is not explicitly provided, DO NOT mention saves

            EVENT TYPE ISOLATION RULES:
            - Each event type has its own specific data - DO NOT mix them
            - Goal time cannot be used as substitution time
            - Substitution time cannot be used as card time
            - Card time cannot be used as goal time
            - Both players in substitution must appear in SAME substitution event

            GENERAL EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE:
            - Only describe events that explicitly appear in the data
            - Exclude anything uncertain, unverified, or not clearly listed
            - Do not fabricate, assume, or infer events not present

            EVENTS:
            {events_str}

            EVENT-PLAYER CORRESPONDENCE RULES:
            - Each event must contain its own player and time data - DO NOT mix between events
            - Goal event player = only the player listed in that Goal event
            - Card event player = only the player listed in that Card event  
            - Substitution event players = only the players listed in that Substitution event
            - Goal time cannot be used as substitution time
            - Card time cannot be used as goal time

            GOAL & ASSIST VALIDATION RULES:
            - Only describe goals from "Goal" events (type="Goal")
            - "player" = who scored, "assist" = who assisted
            - NEVER attribute a goal to a player who only assisted
            - NEVER attribute an assist to a player who only scored

            GOAL COUNT VALIDATION RULES:
            - Use only "Goal" events (type == "Goal") to determine how many goals each player scored.
            - If a player appears only ONCE as the scorer, do NOT say “scored again”, “second goal”, “brace”, “double”, etc.
            - These terms may ONLY be used if the same player appears MULTIPLE times as scorer.
            - If the player scored once, use phrases like “scored a goal” or “found the net”.
            - NEVER assume a player scored more than once unless it's explicitly recorded.

            SUBSTITUTION IDENTITY LOGIC:
            - In substitution events: "in" = player being substituted ON, "out" = player being substituted OFF
            - Only call a player "substituted in" if they appear as the "in" field in a substitution event
            - Only call a player "substituted out" if they appear as the "out" field in the same event
            - Use clear language: "Player X was substituted in, replacing Player Y" or "Player Y was replaced by Player X"
            - Never reverse the order of the players in the substitution event.

            TEAM VERIFICATION FOR EVENTS:
            - Each event (goal, card, substitution) contains a "team" field indicating which team made the event
            - All involved players ("in", "out", "player", "assist") MUST belong to the same team as specified in the "team" field
            - DO NOT list players under the wrong team
            - DO NOT describe players from the opposing team as involved in the current team's event
            - Mention the team name in the storylines
            Example: If team = "Southampton", then both "player" and "assist" must be Southampton players

            VAR EVENTS:
            - If an event has `type = Var` and `detail = Goal cancelled`, do NOT assume the `player` listed scored the goal unless there is a separate `goal` event with the same player.
            - A VAR event involving a player only means the player was affected by or related to the decision — not necessarily the scorer.
            - Only describe a player as scoring a goal if there is an explicit `event_type = goal` with `scorer = player`.
            - Use safe phrasing like "A goal was cancelled by VAR involving [player]" if no scorer is confirmed.

            GOAL TIMING LOGIC:
            - Do NOT describe a goal as "early lead" unless it happens in first half (≤ 45 minutes)
            - If goal occurs after 75th minute, describe as "late winner" or "decisive goal"

            OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY a JSON array of simple strings.
            Example: ["Player A scored the winning goal in the nth minute", "Player B was substituted in at n minutes, replacing Player C", "VAR cancelled a potential goal of Team A for offside, involving Player D", "Half time was reached"]
            
            SUBSTITUTION IMPACT RULES:
            - When analyzing substitutions, evaluate their impact based on subsequent events.
            - If a substituted-in player scored a goal, made an assist, or received a card, describe the substitution as impactful.
            - Highlight linkages: e.g., "Substitute Player A scored the winner after coming on in the nth minute after replacing Player B"
            - If a substitution was followed by no key contribution or came in very late, it should be noted as such.
            - Do not describe substitutions as meaningful unless supported by data (e.g., goal, assist, card).

            STATISTICS VALIDATION RULES:
            - Only use statistics explicitly provided in the data

            PLAYER STATISTICS STORYLINE RULES:
            - Use player statistics and match contribution to determine inclusion
            - DO NOT rely solely on rating for filtering
            - Describe any player who showed meaningful involvement, such as:
              - Playing 60+ minutes with ≥ 80% pass accuracy or ≥ 35+ total passes
              - ≥ 2 tackles, interceptions, or clearances
              - ≥ 4 duels won
              - ≥ 1 goal or assist
            - You may still mention high-rated players (rating ≥ 7.0), but it is not mandatory
            - DO NOT describe players who had zero minutes or no stats
            - DO NOT include yellow or red cards in player performance. Only analyze goals, assists, passes, tackles, duels, etc.
            - In substitution events: "in" = player being substituted ON, "out" = player being substituted OFF
            - For VAR or canceled goals, do NOT assume the player scored unless explicitly stated; only mention the player's involvement and the event. Example: "A goal initially scored by Player A was canceled by VAR at the nth minute." or "A goal was canceled by VAR involving Player A."

            GOAL COUNT VALIDATION (MANDATORY):
            - If a player is described as having scored "a brace", "twice", "two goals", or "a second goal", you MUST verify that the player appears more than once as a scorer in the 'events' section where type == "Goal".
            - If the player appears only once, this is a factual error.
            - Correct any instance of "brace" or "second goal" to reflect the accurate number of goals scored.
            - DO NOT rely on `player_performance` or inferred phrasing. Use `goal` events only.

            CONTRIBUTION FILTERING RULE:
            - Only include players who made notable contributions
            - Focus on players with goals, assists, or substitutions
            - Only mention cards if they lead to red cards or cause significant incidents
            - Avoid listing players with no meaningful involvement
            - DO NOT duplicate information that appears in game_analysis

            OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY a JSON array of simple strings.
            Example: ["J. Zirkzee scored the winning goal in the 87th minute", "A. Diallo was substituted in at 61 minutes, replacing A. Garnacho"]
            
            SUBSTITUTION IMPACT RULES:
            - When analyzing substitutions, evaluate their impact based on subsequent events.
            - If a substituted-in player scored a goal, made an replacement, or received a card, describe the substitution as impactful.
            - Highlight linkages: e.g., "Substitute J. Zirkzee scored the winner after coming on in the 61st minute after replacing M. Mount"
            - If a substitution was followed by no key contribution or came in very late, it should be noted as such.
            - Do not describe substitutions as meaningful unless supported by data (e.g., goal, assist, card).
            - DO NOT infer substitution time from goal/card event.
            - Example (valid): "Player A, who came on in the 46th minute, was booked in the 90th minute"
